/**
 * Iterations - Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.
 * Arrays - Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index
 * Time Complexity - Frog Jump
 * Counting Elements -  Count number of element in an array and store values in another array ex. count frequency of number 0 in array A store in count[0], frequency of number 1 in array A store in count[1] (count[A[i]]+=1)
 *                      FrogRiverOne 
 *                      Permutation check (A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once. เลขในอาร์เรย์ไม่ซ้ำ)
 * Prefix Sums - Sum of arrays from 0-N - PassingCars
        Find sum of the array from start to point N
 * Sorting
 * Stacks and Queues
 * Leader - Element that appear more than half of array size -> Sort -> It should be in the middle / Or remove pair of different elements
 * Maximum slice problem - BallsInBuckets
 * Prime and composite numbers - CountFactors - MinDistinct
 * Sieve Eratosthenes
 * Euclidean algorithm
 * Fibonacci numbers
 * Binary Search
 * Caterpillar method - most frequently/two pointers
 * Greedy algorithm
 * Dynamic programming
